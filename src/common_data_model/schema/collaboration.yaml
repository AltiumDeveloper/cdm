    description: >-
      Task represents a discrete unit of work assigned to a user or team within the design workflow, 
      used to track progress, responsibility, and completion status for design, review, or management activities.
    comments:
      - Each Task has its own identity, state, and assignees, and may be linked to specific design objects, projects, or comments.  
      - It provides structure and accountability in collaborative design processes, supporting review cycles, issue resolution, 
        and workflow coordination across teams within Altium 365.

      - Each Comment Thread has its own identity and lifecycle, grouping related comments and replies into a coherent conversation. 
      - It serves as a persistent communication artifact that promotes design review transparency, traceability, and cross-team collaboration 
        within Altium 365 and connected design tools.
