    title: Multiboard Project
    description: 
      Multiboard Project represents the coordinated design of multiple interconnected PCB projects assembled into a single system, 
      capturing both their logical interconnects and physical arrangements.
    comments:
      - Multiboard Project serves as an aggregate that composes individual board Projects into a higher-level system entity, 
        maintaining identity and traceability across design boundaries. It enables engineers to define harnesses, connectors, and 
        mechanical fit at the system level, while preserving the autonomy of each board design, thus supporting codesign, simulation, 
        and integration workflows across ECAD and MCAD domains.

    title: Harness Project
    description: 
      Harness Project defines the design of a cable and wiring harness as a standalone yet integrable artifact, capturing connectors, 
      wires, splices, and pin-to-pin mappings required to implement electrical interconnects between boards and system elements. 
    comments:
      - Harness Project provides a structured representation of connectivity at the physical wiring level, complementing schematic and 
        PCB projects while maintaining its own lifecycle and identity. It enables engineers to design, document, and validate interconnects 
        in a way that is traceable, manufacturable, and tightly integrated with Multiboard and MCAD workflows within the Altium ecosystem.

    title: Hardware Project Release
    description: 
      Project Release captures an immutable snapshot of a PCB design project at a specific point in its lifecycle, packaging all design data, 
      outputs, and metadata required for manufacturing, assembly, and downstream processes. 
    comments:
      - Project Release serves as the authoritative artifact that bridges design and production, ensuring repeatability, traceability, and regulatory compliance. 
        Its identity is tied to the originating Project but remains stable as a versioned deliverable, enabling teams to collaborate confidently, audit changes, 
        and integrate with supply chain and PLM systems through Altium 365 and related workflows.

    title: Project Template
    description:
      A project template includes document configurations and settings that you know you will frequently apply to various projects. 
    comments:
      - Project templates can include the common document and file types that make up a project, as well as additional reference documentation 
        and configuration files. Project options configured in a project template will also be applied when creating design projects using this template. 
        The advantage of using project templates is that a template can contain, if required, a full set of common project files 
        (including Output Jobs) and ratified project/document options, design rules, parameters, units settings, document title blocks, 
        grid settings, project release options, and much more.
      - Project templates can be created for PCB, multi-board and harness project types.
